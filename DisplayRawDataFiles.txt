Here is how to check the raw data directory on CTA:

xrdfs root://eosctapublicdisk.cern.ch/ ls /eos/ctapublicdisk/archive/na61/raw/22/Pb

Other commands after xrdfs and the host designation are also
available, such as 'mv', 'rm', etc. Extreme caution should be used
here, as this account has full permissions in the directory.

Good luck!
