na61qa is the production account used to store GEM-BPD raw data on
CTA. This is an unfortunate workaround. Here is how to check the raw
data directory on CTA:

xrdfs root://eosctapublicdisk.cern.ch/ ls /eos/ctapublicdisk/archive/na61/raw/22/T2K_GEM

Other commands after xrdfs and the host designation are also
available, such as 'mv', 'rm', etc. Extreme caution should be used
here, as this account has full permissions in the directory.

Good luck!
